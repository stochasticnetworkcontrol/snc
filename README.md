Stochastic Network Control agents and environments


## What is Stochastic Network Control?

# Technology overview
Stochastic Network Control (SNC) provides tools for analysing and optimising stochastic queuing networks, such as automated production lines, emergency unit handling, transportation and storage of goods. For global supply chains, there are many complex and challenging optimisation problems arising from managing these networks, which are typically referred to scheduling, routing, and inventory optimisation. For those domains, SNC allows us to minimise the overall cost while ensuring a target service quality level, improving overall asset utilisation efficiency. 
 
# Core capability and differentiation
The core capability of SNC, as mentioned above, is to simulate such complex network-structured operations, and to improve their efficiency by suggesting better decisions e.g. optimising inventory levels at multiple places simultaneously.
 
Its efficacy can be further highlighted on heavy loaded systems e.g. supply chain networks, that are the most challenging setting for which other existing tools fail. Heavy loaded conditions might be the normal operating conditions for some networks, or can arise temporarily as a result of processing resource malfunctioning or unexpected rise in jobs/items to be processed, as we are observing from the pandemic or climate disruptions. 
 
Key differentiating factors are:
●      Performance. SNC has shown to outperform baselines like MaxWeight and BackPressure under transitory and steady-state regimes. This is expected as the theory predicts that SNC policies achieve near optimal performance for heavy loaded networks.
●      Applicability. SNC can be applied to complex scenarios, in terms of network topologies, activities, constraints and statistical assumptions - while other operation research tools are limited to specific settings.
●      Adaptability. SNC is adaptable even to unexpected disruptions (e.g. breakdown) enabling stronger resilience in supply chains.
●      Explainability. SNC provides explainable recommendations that enable the people making final decisions to understand the assumptions made by the algorithm and the reasons supporting each suggested action.
●      Complexity. Under heavy loaded conditions the control of network resources naturally lends itself to partitioning the decisions onto two independent levels, thus reducing the combinatorial complexity of selecting and issuing control commands.
 
# Application areas 
Live commercial opportunities and strong demand from customers especially in a circular economy that relies on re-using its assets to deliver services. Examples include dynamic safety stock recommendations, asset distribution through a network to meet quality and customer service levels, planning of inventory stock on an assembly line and or a manufacturing process. Initial application areas are and not limited to ULD management and optimisation for Airlines and Air Cargo, Container flow management in Shipping industry, Pallet optimisation in Road logistics.
