## Guaranteed Service Model

### Overview

Current directory has an implementation of GSM inventory optimization algorithm
based on a collection of papers:
* Graves and Willems, 2000
* Humair and Willems, 2006
* Schoenmeyr and Graves, 2016

### Examples of use

Two Jupyter notebooks using most of GSM functionality can be found in notebooks folder under GSM category:
* Demonstration of cascading stockouts
* Numerical replication of experiments from GSM with capacity constraints paper (Schoenmeyr and Graves, 2016)
