    "This notebook consolidates several empirical experiments which demonstrate the impact of removing two underlying assumptions in GSM modeling: no capacity constraints and availablity of extraordinary measures in situations of inventory stockouts at every single link within the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "We identified the prevalence of the following effects:\n",
    "* If even at least one link in the network lacks extraordinary measures to compensate for internal stockouts, then the effective SLA at the customer facing stage will lower then the one guaranteed by idealized GSM solution\n",
    "\n",
    "* The drop in effective SLA is worse for a larger discrepancy between demand stage inventory deviations and its adjacent suppliers. But the negative trend is not linear with the respect to the ration of inventory deviations, but rather goes as square root (or log) of this quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the networks where upstream stages have much larger lead times compared to customer facing stages downstream, placing safety stocks in a more spread manner across the network results in a smaller drop in effective SLA then more sparse and concentrated allocations, which are typical solutions of basic GSM optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In large deep serial networks, propagating stockouts from upstream tend to be attenuated by the safety stocks at intermediate stages before it reaches customer facing inventory. Typically the effect of propagating stockouts is determined mostly by the most adjacent (or direct) upstream neighbours. \n",
