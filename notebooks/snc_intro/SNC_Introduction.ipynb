    "This notebook is conceived as a counterpart to real-live tutorial at the whiteboard, which SNC members present to newcomers to the team. Thus most of the concepts and diagrams make most intuitive sense when presented/drawn live and their relations to other items can be reiterated verbally and graphicaly on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial itself was meant to characterise the notion of Stochastic Network Control using very basic and intuitive mathematical concepts. Through this process very relevant insights relating to the network control were revealed."

    "## What network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any generic network has two constituitive elements: network nodes and the links/edges connecting individual nodes to each other as well as to the world ouside of network boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SNC network nodes are represented as a collection of buffers where the queues of items accumulate with time. Items can be arbitrary jobs, packets, clients, stock inventory, etc. The current number of items in all the buffers define the state of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of items into/out-of/within the network boundaries is determined by set of activities which essentially take the role of directed links/edges in the network. Each activity \"transfers\" items from one set of buffers to another and can stand for \n",
    "\n",
    "- manufacturing process - where items from different input (with respect to activity) buffers are combined/transformed to create different items in output buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "- transportation process - where items preserve their identity but move to another location such as between warehouse and retail inventories\n",
    "    \n",
    "- servicing process - where clients (in a bank, hospital, airport) are serviced and are directed to the next stage\n",
    "- etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Activities are naturally performed \"in time\" and therefore have characteristic processing rates, literally meaning how many jobs/items can be processed/transfered between the input and output buffers per unit of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In accordance with real life systems there are associated costs with having items waiting in the buffer queues and with performing activities for decided periods of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to buffers(nodes) and activities(directed links) there is a third type of elements characteristic to SNC networks - resources. Resource is an entity (physical typicaly) which performs a selected set of activities. Drawing from the examples for items and activities mentioned above, corresponding resources will be processing equipment, transportation vehicles and service personnel. The underlying physical constraint on individual resources is that they cannot perform multiple activities simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources are the only controllable elements within the network and the associated decision variables are: \n",
    "- when to engage the resources on selected activites _and_\n",
    "- for how long should they operate _and_ \n",
    "- in what sequence relative to each other  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically items can be independently entering (or leaving) the network boundaries at predetermined locations (buffers). These activities are external and uncontrollable by the resources of the network in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the three fundamental building blocks from above we can formulate a provisional definition of a network control: by managing the working time of resources on selected activites we can change the state of the network (i.e. the number of items in each of its buffers). \n",
    "\n",
    "So far this provisional definition has an element of arbitrariness to it since we are not specifying why we want this or that particular change in the state of the network. It is equivalent to specifying how steering and pushing pedals changes the speed and position of the car without even considering that we ultimately want to use the car as means of transportation from one location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more criterion based notion of network control requires introduction of some sort of end-goal-state or end-goal-sequence-of-states of the network. For the car analogy this would be to specify further that basic controls need to be used to maintain the car on the road at steady speed. For the networks we are considering the end-goal-state might be the one where all the buffers are empty (no more customers waiting in the queues) or at some provided set-point level (such as inventory safety stock level). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the requirement of optimality in controlling the network specifies _how_ the end-goal-state of the network has to be reached. Possible optimality criteria for deciding between alternative action sequences to reach the end-state include minimum time to reach desired end-goal-state of the network, minimum cumulative activity cost incured, minimum cumulative network state cost incured or both. Mentioning the driving analogy for the last time, optimal objective can be to reach end destination in the shortest amount of time and/or using the least amount of fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What stochasticity?\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this section we need to clarify in what sense we use term \"stochastic\" when speaking of networks and their control. The more limited use of \"stochastic\" in our context refers to the fact that when activities are performed the amount of items being processed at each timestep might not be at the exact deterministic rate, but rather on average at this \"mean rate\" plus-or-minus some noisy variation. This use will be assumed throughout this notebook and most of the more advanced tutorials to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broader use of \"stochastic\" as applied to networks of interest refers to unpredictable shock events such as failures of resources, loss of items in the buffer queues or excessive amount of new item arrivals into the network. We do not seem to be modelling this events explicitly but rather expect the optimally derived policy (Hedgehog) to adapt instanteneously to the sudden change in the state of the network. These \"unpredicatbility\" is beyond the scope of this introductory tutorial."

    "It is important to observe that each activity $i$ has to compute only $z_i^*$ to obtain both the sign and coefficient  for the buffer it is responsible for, i.e., buffer $j$. For the other buffers, resource $i$ just need to identify the correlation with the activity $h$ that immediately precedes $j$ in the message flow, and then 'inherits' from $h$ both the sign and the coefficient. In particular, if the correlation between $i$ and $h$ is positive, the missing elements in the row of $B^{-1}$ related to $i$ are exactly the corresponding elements in the row related to $h$; otherwise, if the correlation is negative, $i$ would 'inherit' $h$'s coefficients but with the opposite sign.\n",
